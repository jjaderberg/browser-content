=== Graphs

An introduction to basic concepts.

1.  Nodes - graph data records
2.  Relationships - connect nodes
3.  Properties - named data values

[[agraph-database]]
=== AÂ __Graph__ Database

Neo4j stores data in a Graph, with records called Nodes.

The simplest graph has just a single node with some named values called
Properties. Let's draw a social graph of our friends on the Neo4j team:

1.  Start by drawing a circle for the node
2.  Add the name Emil
3.  Note that he is from Sweden

* Nodes are the name for data records in a graph
* Data is stored as Properties
* Properties are simple name/value pairs

[[labels]]
=== Labels

Associate a set of nodes.

Nodes can be grouped together by applying a Label to each member. In our
social graph, we'll label each node that represents a Person.

1.  Apply the label "Person" to the node we created for Emil
2.  Color "Person" nodes red

* A node can have zero or more labels
* Labels do not have any properties

[[more-nodes]]
=== More Nodes

Schema-free, nodes can have a mix of common and unique properties.

Like any database, storing data in Neo4j can be as simple as adding more
records. We'll add a few more nodes:

1.  Emil has a klout score of 99
2.  Johan, from Sweden, who is learning to surf
3.  Ian, from England, who is an author
4.  Rik, from Belgium, has a cat named Orval
5.  Allison, from California, who surfs

* Similar nodes can have different properties
* Properties can be strings, numbers, or booleans
* Neo4j can store billions of nodes

[[consider-relationships]]
=== Consider Relationships

Connect nodes in the graph

The real power of Neo4j is in connected data. To associate any two
nodes, add a Relationship which describes how the records are related.

In our social graph, we simply say who KNOWS whom:

1.  Emil KNOWS Johan and Ian
2.  Johan KNOWS Ian and Rik
3.  Rik and Ian KNOWS Allison

* Relationships always have direction
* Relationships always have a type
* Relationships form patterns of data

[[relationship-properties]]
=== Relationship properties

Store information shared by two nodes.

In a property graph, relationships are data records that can also
contain properties. Looking more closely at Emil's relationships, note
that:

* Emil has known Johan since 2001
* Emil rates Ian 5 (out of 5)
* Everyone else can have similar relationship properties

[[next-steps]]
=== Next steps

A property graph contains nodes and relationships, with properties on
both. Having "whiteboarded" a graph, you are ready to create a graph in
Neo4j.
