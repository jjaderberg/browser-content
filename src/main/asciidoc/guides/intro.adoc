=== Introduction

Getting started with Neo4j Browser

Neo4j Browser is a command driven client, like a web-based shell
environment. It is perfect for running ad-hoc graph queries, with just
enough ability to prototype a Neo4j-based application.

* Developer focused, for writing and running graph queries with Cypher
* Exportable tabular results of any query result
* Graph visualization of query results containing nodes and
relationships
* Convenient exploration of Neo4j's REST API

[[editor]]
=== Editor

Command editing and execution

The editor is the primary interface for entering and running commands.
Enter Cypher queries to work with graph data. Use client-side commands
like`:help` for other operations.

* Single line editing for brief queries or commands
* Switch to multi-line editing with <shift-enter>
* Run a query with <ctrl-enter>
* History is kept for easily retrieving previous commands

[[stream]]
=== Stream

Scrolling series of result frames

A result frame is created for each command execution, added to the top
of the stream to create a scrollable collection in reverse chronological
order.

* Special frames like data visualization
* Expand a frame to full screen
* Remove a specific frame from the stream
* Clear the stream with the Â `:clear` command

* Information links for docs and reference
* Credits and licensing information
