=== EXPLAIN

Explain query execution

Prefix any query with the `EXPLAIN` keyword to have Neo4j return the
execution plan it would use to execute the query. However, the query is
not executed, and Neo4j will make no changes to the database.

See :help QUERY PLAN for a guide to understanding the query plan output.
